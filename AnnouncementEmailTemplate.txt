You need to enter from the Lauriston Place entrance. Someone will be on-hand at reception to let you in. If there isn't feel free to call me on <phone> and I'll come and let you in.

This month we have talks from:

There's (free) drinks, pizza, snacks and plenty of time around the talks to catch up on the latest tech news and gossip.

As always, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

Big thanks to our sponsors: Skyscanner, Neo and Informatics Ventures.

Techmeetup is a community event, so if you want to speak or help out in some way please email me off list or speak to one of the organisers at the event.

See you on Wednesday!
